Render HTML from Jade, Handlebars, Swig and most other kinds of templates on the command line. Render can iterate over input and generate multiple output files from a single source of data, named however you like, using filename templates (think: routes).

Render uses the [consolidate.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/consolidate.js) template engine consolidation library for all heavy lifting.
